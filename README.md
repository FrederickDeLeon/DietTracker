# DietTracker
This was a fun little project I made to practice coding in Java. The main goal of it is to track the calories and protein of food the user enters into the program and then sum it all together and return it. I want to eventually expand the features of this program to include a database of sorts based on the information gathered from the user's food entries, as well as keeping track of more nutritional information such as fat, carbs, and sodium content. This database could be used so that the program can refer to it without needing to ask the user for information on the entered food's calorie count or protein content.
