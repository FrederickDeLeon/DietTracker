# DietTracker - GUI Prototype

**Branch Notice:** This branch contains an in-development Swing GUI for the DietTracker application. It's a work-in-progress and not yet feature-complete. The stable console version is on the `main` branch.

A Java application for tracking daily nutritional intake with intelligent data persistence. The system maintains a searchable food database to eliminate redundant data entry and provides daily nutritional summaries.

## Core Features:

* **Persistent Food Database**: Automatically saves nutritional data to file storage, maintaining all food information between application sessions
* **Database Management**: View all saved foods or completely clear the database as needed
* **Daily Log**: Tracks daily food consumption and calculates total nutritional values
* **Smart Entry**: Automatically checks new entries against the existing database and prompts users to save new foods for future use
* **Efficient Workflow**: Reduces repetitive data input by recalling previously saved food information

## Current Status
- âœ… Core backend functionality (data persistence, CRUD operations)
- Swing GUI implementation (in progress)
- Active development
